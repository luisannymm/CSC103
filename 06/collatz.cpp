/* TODO: write a program to test the *Collatz* conjecture.  This conjecture
 * says that no matter what positive integer n I start with, the following
 * sequence always terminates in a finite number of steps:
 * 1. if n is 1, quit.
 * 2. if n is even, divide it by 2 and continue
 * 3. if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1, then continue.
 * E.g., if n begins as 6, the sequence would be:
 *    6,3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1
 * Your program should read n, then print the number of steps until
 * you reach 1.  Number of steps for the above example is 8 (if n
 * is already 1, we would say it took 0 steps to get to 1).
 * Bonus (also good practice for project 2!) read more than one integer:
 * instead of doing the test once and quitting, read an integer, output
 * the number of steps, read another integer, output # of steps, and so
 * on, until stdin is exhausted.
